# RxViewElementsExperiment
Experimenting ViewElements+RxSwift for data-driven UI.

## Overview
[ViewElements](https://github.com/aunnnn/ViewElements) makes it easily to create a static page in UITableView. 
However, to support more data-driven/interactive use-cases such as input form and real-time input checking, we need more complex setup, which is not straightforward or intuitive.
This project is an experiement to combine ViewElements with RxSwift. It will serve as an example, or might go further to give birth to a new add-on framework.
